# rclone-source-to-destination-script

Simple script, must have rclone in environment path, the script will prompt to add checksum or not, source and destination path and checks if they exists.

Just have to set the logPath for the log file location. The created logfile will have the format of Copy source to destination - Date=yyyy-mm-dd & Time=hh.mm.ss. Can edit the flags directly in the python file to taste.
